Objective: Create a marketplace platform where dog owners can easily buy, sell, and manage items for their pets.
# Who
PawHub is designed for dog owners who want to:
- Buy and sell pet items like toys, food or accessories within a community
- Track inventory for essentials like dog food, including quantity, price, and expiry dates
- Communicate with buyers or sellers for a seamless trading experience
# Challenges / Needs
Dog owners often face challenges managing pet supplies and communicating with others for purchases:
- Lack of a dedicated platform for dog-related item exchanges and inventory tracking.
- Inefficiency in managing inventory and keeping track of essential supplies like dog food.
- Difficulty in coordinating meetups, especially when finding the best route for location-based exchanges.
